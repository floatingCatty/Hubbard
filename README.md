## ðŸš€ About hubbard

hubbard is a python package that solves the hubbard model. It provides solver interfaces, and quantum embedding method implemented with ghost-Gutzwiller(gGA). 

For solvers:
- exact diagonalization (scipy)
- density matrix renormalization group (block2)
- neural quantum states (Quantax)

You can use the solver as a standalone tools to solve the Hubbard model, or use those as the solvers for the gGA workflow.

The document are in preparation, for usage, please check out the examples where direct usage and gGA workflow usage are given. For questions, please raise an issue, we will be in touch shortly!
